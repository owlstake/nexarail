For Cosmos/Tendermint-based chains, Tenderduty is additionally utilized for validator monitoring.                            |
| Backup / Snapshot Strategy | Backup servers are maintained for rapid emergency recovery. We provide public RPC/API endpoints, regular snapshots, and state-sync support, all accessible at: https://services.owlstake.com |
